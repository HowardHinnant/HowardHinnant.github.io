<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this paper is <b>not</b> to propose a date class.
</p>

<p>
This paper derives and documents key algorithms that enable one to write
their own date class.  The purpose of this paper is to allow everyone to
easily write their own date class, using algorithms that are well
documented, and easily modified to meet individual needs.  The
algorithms presented are efficient. They require no external tables. 
They do not require C++11 or C++1y features, though if C++11 is
available, the algorithms should be <code>noexcept</code>, and if C++1y
is available, they can trivially be made <code>constexpr</code>.
</p>

<p>
This paper does not document a library.  It is a <i>how-to</i> manual
for writing the algorithm part of your own date class.  The syntax and
some of the language features come from C++11 and even C++1y.  However
the algorithms can be ported to any language.
</p>

<p>
The algorithms are interoperable with every known implementation of
<code>std::chrono::system_clock</code>, though that interoperability depends
on an unspecified property of the <code>system_clock</code>: its epoch.  Example
code will be shown how these algorithms can take advantage of the common
(but unspecified) <code>system_clock</code> epoch.
</p>

<p>
The algorithms implement a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Gregorian_calendar">proleptic Gregorian calendar</a>.
That is, the
rules which adopted the Julian calendar in 1582 in Rome are applied both
backwards and forwards in time.  This includes a year 0, and then
negative years before that, all following the rules for the Gregorian
calendar.  From hence forth this paper will refer to this as the
<i>civil</i> calendar.  The accuracy of the algorithms under these rules
is exact, until overflow occurs.  Using 32 bit arithmetic, overflow
occurs approximately at +/- 5.8 million years.  Using 64 bit arithmetic
overflow occurs far beyond +/- the age of the universe.  The intent is
to make range checking superfluous.
</p>

<p>
The algorithms implement no validity checking.  The intent is that any desired
validity checking on the triple <code>year/month/day</code> can be added on
top of these algorithms if and where desired.
</p>

<p>
Ten low-level algorithms are presented:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
Convert from a <code>year/month/day</code> triple to a serial day number.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class Int&gt;
constexpr
Int
days_from_civil(Int y, unsigned m, unsigned d) noexcept;
</pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Convert from a serial day number to a <code>year/month/day</code> triple.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class Int&gt;
constexpr
std::tuple&lt;Int, unsigned, unsigned&gt;
civil_from_days(Int z) noexcept;
</pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Determine if a year is a leap year.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class Int&gt;
constexpr
bool
is_leap(Int y) noexcept;
</pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Given the month, return the last day of the month of a common year.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
constexpr
unsigned
last_day_of_month_common_year(unsigned m) noexcept;
</pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Given the month, return the last day of the month of a leap year.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
constexpr
unsigned
last_day_of_month_leap_year(unsigned m) noexcept;
</pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Given the year and month, return the last day of the month.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class Int&gt;
constexpr
unsigned
last_day_of_month(Int y, unsigned m) noexcept;
</pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Convert from a serial day number to a day of the week.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class Int&gt;
constexpr
unsigned
weekday_from_days(Int z) noexcept;
</pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Subtract one weekday from another (e.g. Sun - Sat is 1, and Sat - Sun is 6).
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
constexpr
unsigned
weekday_difference(unsigned x, unsigned y) noexcept;
</pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Get the weekday following a weekday (e.g. Mon follows Sun).
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
constexpr
unsigned
next_weekday(unsigned wd) noexcept;
</pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Get the weekday prior to a weekday (e.g. Sat comes before Sun).
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
constexpr
unsigned
prev_weekday(unsigned wd) noexcept;
</pre></blockquote>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
The algorithms are templated on year number type and serial day number
type so that you can easily vary the range (use <code>int</code>,
<code>long long</code>, <code>big_num</code>, or whatever).  For those
fields that are known to be unsigned and small (e.g. month)
<code>unsigned</code> is used.  Feel free to substitute any type you
like. The use of <code>unsigned</code> is just to demonstrate that this
particular field is constrained in the algorithm to always remain within
a non-negative range.
</p>

<p>
Building upon these low-level algorithms, higher-level algorithms can
easily be written, and this paper shows several examples of such
higher-level algorithms.
</p>

<p>
First the algorithm, and then the explanation:

<p>
As explained in the introduction, the type of <code>year</code> is templated
so that you can easily set your own range based on your own needs.  And if
you dislike the use of <code>unsigned</code> for <code>month</code> and
<code>day</code>, please change them to whatever suits you.  Doing so will
not impact the correctness of the algorithm.  And if you're not compiling under
C++1y <code>constexpr</code> rules, you will need to remove (or comment out)
the <code>constexpr</code>.  If you are compiling in C++98/03 you can substitute
<code>throw()</code> for <code>noexcept</code>, or remove the exception
specification entirely.
</p>

<p>
The first two algorithms also do some static checking on the range of
<code>Int</code> and <code>unsigned</code>.  It is possible to port
these algorithms to a 16 bit machine.  It just involves being more
careful with casts, and the use of integral types that are known to be
at least 32 bits in a few key places.  For the purposes of presentation,
and because it has been a long time since I've personally come in
contact with a 16 bit machine, I've chosen to assume the machine is at
least 32 bits, but documented that assumption with
<code>static_assert</code>.  If you are interested in porting these algorithms
to a 16 bit machine, then you need to pay attention to the lines which are
commented with the ranges of the variable being computed.
</p>

<p>
These algorithms internally assume that March 1 is the first day of the year.
This is convenient because it puts the leap day, Feb. 29 as the last day of the
year, or actually the preceding year.  That is, Feb. 15, 2000, is considered by
this algorithm to be the 15th day of the last month of the year 1999.  Don't
worry, this complication is securely encapsulated in this and the other
algorithms.  This detail is only important for understanding how the algorithm
works, and is not exposed to the client of these algorithms.
</p>

<p>
Additionally the first two algorithms make use of the concept of an <i>era</i>.
This concept is not exposed to the client, but is very handy in creating an
algorithm that is valid over extremely large ranges.  In these algorithms, an
era is a 400 year period.  As it turns out, the civil calendar exactly
repeats itself every 400 years.  And so these algorithms will first compute the
era of a <code>year/month/day</code> triple, or the era of a serial date, and
then factor the era out of the computation.  The rest of the computation centers
on concepts such as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
What is the year of the era (<code>yoe</code>)?  This is always in the
range <code>[0, 399]</code>.
</li>
<li>
What is the day of the era (<code>doe</code>)?  This is always in the
range <code>[0, 146096]</code>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The wonderful thing about this approach is that you only need to debug a single
era (146097 days), and the transformation to and from eras, and then you have
all time debugged.  Below is a table of eras mapped to civil dates.
Note that in this table the year number is the civil year number for Jan.
and Feb., not the internal year number used within the algorithm.
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="1" cellpadding="10">

<tr>
<td>-2</td><td>-0800-03-01</td><td>-0400-02-29</td>

</tr>
</table>

<p>
So the first thing the <code>days_from_civil</code> algorithm does is
transform the <code>year</code> number to the internal one for Jan. and
Feb.  And then the era is computed.  For non-negative years, the era is
simply <code>y/400</code>. But for negative years one has to be careful
that years [-400, -1] map to era -1.  By using
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation">floored</a>
or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_division">Euclidean</a>
division, negative years are correctly accounted for.  Also note that in
C++98/03 it is implementation defined whether integral division is
implemented as truncated, floored or Euclidean.  Only C++11 specifies truncated
division.  So if you are using a C++98/03 compiler that implements
floored or Euclidean division you can actually simplify the computation of the
<code>era</code> to simply <code>y / 400</code>. Again, once the
algorithm takes negative years into account in this one place,
everything else can be done with unsigned arithmetic: everything else is
non-negative.
</p>

<p>
Once the <code>era</code> is known (this is generally a signed number of
unknown range), the year-of-era can easily be computed by subtracting
off the <code>year</code> from <code>era * 400</code>.  This is the same
as the modulo operation, but assuming
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation">floored</a>
or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_division">Euclidean</a>
division, as opposed to the truncated division/modulo operation that C++11
specifies. This will result in an unsigned number in the range of [0,
399], whether the <code>era</code> is negative or non-negative.
</p>

<p>
At the same time as the <code>yoe</code> computation is happening, we can also
compute the day-of-year (<code>doy</code>) which is an unsigned number in the
range of [0, 364] for a non-leap year, and for leap years has a range of
[0, 365].  A value of 0 corresponds to Mar 1, and a value of 364 corresponds to
Feb. 28 of the following (civil) year.
</p>

<p>
The <code>doy</code> computation is quite unintuitive and deserves an in-depth
explanation.
</p>

<blockquote>

<h3><a name="Computing day-of-year from month and day-of-month"></a>Computing day-of-year from month and day-of-month</h3>

<p>
We need a formula that maps Mar. 1 to 0, Mar. 2 to 1, etc. up to
Feb. 29 of the following year to 365.  This computation can be broken down into
several parts:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Map civil month number [1, 12] (Jan. - Dec.) into the internal month
numbering [0, 11] (Mar. - Feb.).
</li>
<li>
Compute the number of days between Mar. 1 and the first day of the current
month.
</li>
<li>
Add the number of days between the current day of the month and the first day
of the current month.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Let's start with the second bullet:  Map a month number <code>m'</code>
in the range [0, 11] (Mar. - Feb.) into a range such that the first day
of the month <code>m'</code> is <code>x</code> number of days after Mar.
1.
</p>

<p>
This can be exactly expressed as a table:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="1" cellpadding="10">
<tr>
<th>month</th><th><code>m'</code></th><th>days after m'-01</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mar</td><td>0</td><td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Apr</td><td>1</td><td>31</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>May</td><td>2</td><td>61</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jun</td><td>3</td><td>92</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jul</td><td>4</td><td>122</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aug</td><td>5</td><td>153</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sep</td><td>6</td><td>184</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Oct</td><td>7</td><td>214</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nov</td><td>8</td><td>245</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dec</td><td>9</td><td>275</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jan</td><td>10</td><td>306</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Feb</td><td>11</td><td>337</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
However we would like to translate this table into a linear polynomial.
</p>

<blockquote>
<i>a1 m' + a0</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that a beautiful property of this table is that it does not depend
upon whether or not the current year is a leap year.  The leap day is
either applied to the end of the last month in the table or not, and can
not impact any rows in the table, not even the last row.
</p>

<p>
The slope of this straight line can be easily computed by <code>337/11
== 30.63636363636364</code>. However integral round off complicates this
formula, and the y-intercept of this linear equation can be manipulated
to give the desired results.  Assume we have the following function but with
known constants for <code>a1</code> and <code>a0</code>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
int
doy_from_month(int mp)
{
    return a1 * mp + a0;
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
With this we can easily
write a comprehensive unit test for <code>doy_from_month</code>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;cassert&gt;

// Returns day of year for 1st day of month mp, mp == 0 is Mar, mp == 11 is Feb.
int
doy_from_month(int mp)
{
    return a1 * mp + a0;
}

int
main()
{
    int a[12] = {0, 31, 61, 92, 122, 153, 184, 214, 245, 275, 306, 337};
    for (int mp = 0; mp &lt; 12; ++mp)
        assert(doy_from_month(mp) == a[mp]);
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If we make <code>a1 == 30</code> or <code>a1 == 31</code>, there is no
value for <code>a0</code> we can assign to make this unit test pass.  However
we can manipulate the y-intercept (<code>a0</code>) in a very fine manner if
we express the equation as:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
return (b1 * mp + b0) / a0;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The first best guess is to make <code>b1 == 337</code> and <code>a0 ==
11</code>.  However when doing so there is no value of <code>b0</code> that
will pass the unit test.  However if we make <code>b1 == 306</code> and
<code>a0 == 10</code> (i.e. <code>306/10 &#8776; 30.63636363636364</code>) then
there are actually two formulations that pass all unit tests:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>return (306 * mp + 4) / 10;</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>return (306 * mp + 5) / 10;</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I first arbitrarily selected the second.  However note that the first can be
simplified down to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>return (153 * mp + 2) / 5;</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
For reasons I do not fully understand, this latter formula tests slightly faster
(about 2%) than the others.
</p>

<p>
Now <code>mp</code> represents
<code>m'</code> or the month number that starts with Mar == 0.  We also
need to map the civil month number (Mar == 3) (<code>m</code>) to
our internal month number (<code>mp</code>).  This can be done by adding
9 to <code>m</code>, and taking the modulus of the result by 12:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
mp = (m + 9) % 12;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This formula results in the following relationship:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="1" cellpadding="10">
<tr>
<th><code>m</code></th><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>12</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th><code>mp</code></th><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td>
</tr>

</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
After some performance testing I discovered that replacing the <code>%</code>
with a branch was actually slightly faster, at least on the Core i5 I'm testing
on:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
mp = m + (m &gt; 2 ? -3 : 9);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Putting this together we now have a formula for taking a civil month number
and computing the number of days between the first of that month, and Mar 1:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
(153*(m + (m &gt; 2 ? -3 : 9)) + 2)/5
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Now to get the day-of-year from the double <code>month/day</code> one simply
adds the day-of-the-month, minus 1:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
const unsigned doy = (153*(m + (m &gt; 2 ? -3 : 9)) + 2)/5 + d - 1;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
One can spot-check this formula in a few places:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="1" cellpadding="10">
<tr>
<th><code>m</code></th><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th><code>d</code></th><td>1</td><td>29</td><td>28</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th><code>doy</code></th><td>0</td><td>365</td><td>364</td>
</tr>

</table>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>
Now given year-of-era (<code>yoe</code>) and day-of-year (<code>doy</code>),
we can easily calculate the day-of-era (<code>doe</code>).  This is simply 365
days for every year, plus another day for every 4 years, minus a day for every
hundred years, plus the day-of-year:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
const unsigned doe = yoe * 365 + yoe / 4 - yoe / 100 + doy;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Those familiar with this particular computation might question the lack of the
term:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
+ yoe / 400
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
in the above formula.  It would actually be correct to put it in.  However note
that <code>yoe</code> is always in the range [0, 399], and so the contribution
of this term is always 0.
</p>

<p>
The final computation in <code>days_from_civil</code> is computing the serial date
from the <code>era</code> and from the day-of-era (<code>doe</code>).  This
is simply:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
return era * 146097 + static_cast&lt;Int&gt;(doe)
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
which gives the number of days, before, or after, 0000-03-01.  However note
that I've also subtracted 719468 from this final computation in the actual
<code>days_from_civil</code> code.  This is a shift which aligns this algorithm
with all known implementations of <code>std::chrono::system_clock</code>.  It
makes the serial date 0 be equivalent to 1970-01-01 instead of 0000-03-01.
</p>

All known implementations of <code>std::chrono::system_clock</code> count
seconds from 1970-01-01, neglecting leap seconds.  This is known as

are not required by the standard to use this measure.  But it can be handy to

<h2><a name="civil_from_days"></a><code>civil_from_days</code></h2>

<p>
Now that we can use <code>days_from_civil</code> to convert a
<code>year/month/day</code> triple into a serial date, it is really
handy to be able to go the other way: convert a serial date into a
<code>year/month/day</code> triple.  And this is exactly what
<code>civil_from_days</code> does.  First the algorithm, and then the
explanation:

<p>
Many of the same concepts used in developing <code>days_from_civil</code> are reused
here.  If you've skipped that section because you're just interested in this
algorithm, you may want to go back and read it anyway, as the concepts will not
be re-explained here.
</p>

<p>
The first step in the computation is to shift the epoch from 1970-01-01 to
0000-03-01:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
z += 719468;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Now we can compute the <code>era</code> from the serial date by simply dividing
by the number of days in an <code>era</code> (146097).  Again
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation">floored</a>
or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_division">Euclidean</a>
division must be used to correctly handle negative days.
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
const Int era = (z &gt;= 0 ? z : z - 146096) / 146097;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The day-of-era (<code>doe</code>) can then be found by subtracting the
era number times the number of days per era, from the serial date. This
is the same as the modulo operation, but assuming
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation">floored</a>
or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_division">Euclidean</a>
division. This always results in a <code>doe</code> in the range [0,
146096].
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
const unsigned doe = static_cast&lt;unsigned&gt;(z - era * 146097);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
From the day-of-era (<code>doe</code>), the year-of-era (<code>yoe</code>,
range [0, 399]) can be computed.  This formula can be derived one piece at a
time.  To start, the <code>yoe</code> can be approximated by simply dividing
<code>doe</code> by 365:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
const unsigned yoe = doe / 365;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This is actually correct for <code>doe</code> in the range [0, 1459],
yielding a <code>yoe</code> in the range of [0, 3].  However 1460 / 365
is 4.  But there are 1461 days in the first 4 years of an era (4*365+1),
which are labeled as years 0 thru 3.  So we must alter the formula so
that 1460 (the last day of year 3) results in 3, but 1461 (the first day
of year 4) results in 4:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
const unsigned yoe = (doe - doe / 1460) / 365;
</pre></blockquote>

<p> Now the formula is accurate for <code>doe</code> in the range [0,
36523], yielding a <code>yoe</code> in the range of [0, 99].  but the
first hundred years of an era has 36524 days in it (365 * 100 + 100/4 -
1 == 36524).  36524 (the first day of year 100) should yield 100, but
instead yields 99 in the above formula which is incorrect.  To correct this
the formula can be augmented again:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
const unsigned yoe = (doe - doe/1460 + doe/36524) / 365;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Now inputing 36524 yields 100.  And indeed the formula is now correct up until
the very last day in an era, day number 146096.  On this day, the last day of
the era, and the last day of year 399, the above formula yields 400 instead of
399.  The formula can be made exact for every day in the era with one more
adjustment:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
const unsigned yoe = (doe - doe/1460 + doe/36524 - doe/146096) / 365;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Given year-of-era, and era, one can now compute the year number:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
const Int y = static_cast&lt;Int&gt;(yoe) + era * 400;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Note though that this year number is still in terms of a year that begins on
Mar. 1, not Jan. 1.
</p>

<p>
Also the day-of-year, again with the year beginning on Mar. 1, can be computed
from the day-of-era and year-of-era.  One simply subtracts from the day-of-era
the days that have occurred in all prior years of this era:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
const unsigned doy = doe - (365 * yoe + yoe / 4 - yoe / 100);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Again note the absence of the correct term <code>+ yoe / 400</code> because the
contribution of this term is always zero since 399 is the upper range of
<code>yoe</code>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<h3><a name="Computing month from day-of-year"></a>Computing month from day-of-year</h3>

<p>
When developing <code>days_from_civil</code> we had to develop a linear equation
to compute the day-of-year from the first day of month <code>m'</code> where
<code>m'</code> is in the range [0, 11] representing [Mar, Feb].
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
int
doy_from_month(int mp)
{
    return (153 * mp + 2) / 5;
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Now we need the inverse of this formula:  Given day-of-year, we need to find
the month number.  If integral arithmetic was exact, the derivation would be
straight forward algebra and we would get:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
int
month_from_doy(int doy)
{
    return (5 * doy - 2) / 153;
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Before accepting this as the correct answer, it is wise to build a unit test
for this function.  The one developed for <code>doy_from_month</code> can easily
be augmented to test both of these functions at the same time:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
int
main()
{
    int a[12][2] =
    {
        {0, 30},
        {31, 60},
        {61, 91},
        {92, 121},
        {122, 152},
        {153, 183},
        {184, 213},
        {214, 244},
        {245, 274},
        {275, 305},
        {306, 336},
        {337, 365}
    };

    for (int mp = 0; mp &lt; 12; ++mp)
    {
        assert(doy_from_month(mp) == a[mp][0]);
        assert(month_from_doy(a[mp][0]) == mp);
        assert(month_from_doy(a[mp][1]) == mp);
    }
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The pair of numbers in <code>a</code> are the first and last numbers of the
day-of-year for each month in [0, 11].  We already have a function
<code>doy_from_month(mp)</code> which computes the starting day-of-year for
each month, and tested by the first <code>assert</code> in the program.  And
now two more <code>assert</code>s are added to test that given both the
first and last day of each month, <code>month_from_doy</code> can transform
that day-of-year into the correct month number <code>mp</code>.
</p>

<p>
Running this test on the <code>month_from_doy</code> given above, we see that
our first attempt at derivation using simple algebra is incorrect.  However it
is close.  The slope of the linear equation is correct.  We just need to
experiment with the y-intercept to discover the correct formula.  There exist
three which will pass the above unit test:
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>return (10*doy + 4) / 306;</code></li>
<li><code>return ( 5*doy + 2) / 153;</code></li>
<li><code>return (10*doy + 5) / 306;</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
I've chosen the second for use in <code>civil_from_days</code> because it
appears to have a slight performance advantage:
</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote><pre>
const unsigned mp = (5*doy + 2)/153;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
From day-of-year and month-of-year we can now easily compute
day-of-month by reusing the <code>doy_from_month</code> formula
developed for <code>days_from_civil</code>. One just subtracts from the
day-of-year all of the days that occurred in the previous months of this
year.  One is added to the result since the day count is 1-based instead
of 0-based.
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
const unsigned d = doy - (153*mp+2)/5 + 1;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Next we need to transform the month number from the [0, 11] / [Mar, Feb] system
to the civil system: [1, 12].  I've found that branching is faster than using
<code>%</code>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
const unsigned m = mp + (mp &lt; 10 ? 3 : -9);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Now the only thing left to do is to transform the year number from the internal
format (begins in Mar.) to the civil format (begins in Jan.).  This is done
simply by adding 1 to the year if the month is Jan. or Feb.  I've returned
this result in a <code>std::tuple</code> for no good reason at all.  You should
return the triple <code>year/month/day</code> in whatever format is convenient
for you.
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
return std::tuple&lt;Int, unsigned, unsigned&gt;(y + (m &lt;= 2), m, d);
</pre></blockquote>

<h2><a name="is_leap"></a><code>is_leap</code></h2>

<p>
Even though the conversions between <code>year/month/day</code> and the
serial date do not need to compute whether or not a year is a leap year,
it is still very handy to know whether or not a year is a leap year. 
This function answers that question.  First the algorithm, and then the
explanation:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="1" cellpadding="10">
<tr><td>
<pre>
<font color="#C80000">// Returns: true if y is a leap year in the civil calendar, else false</font>
template &lt;class Int&gt;
constexpr
bool
is_leap(Int y) noexcept
{
    return  y % 4 == 0 && (y % 100 != 0 || y % 400 == 0);
}
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
The formula is designed to return an answer as quickly as possible for a random
year.  75.75% of all years are not leap years.  We can find 99% of the non-leap years
with only one test: <code>y % 4 != 0</code>.  If the year is not evenly
divisible by 4, then it is definitely not a leap year, and short circuiting will
cause a return at this point without evaluating the rest of the formula.
</p>

<p>
Of the 25% of the years that are evenly divisibly by 4, these <i>might</i> be a
leap year.  96% of these 25% are and can be dispatched with a second test:
<code>y %100 != 0</code>.  If the year is evenly divisible by 4 and not evenly
divisible by 100, then it is definitely a leap year, and short circuiting will
return here for those years.  The remaining 4% of the 25% (or 1% of the total
number of years) require one more test.  These are years that are known to be
divisible by 100.  If they are also evenly divisible by 400, then they are a
leap year, else they are not.
</p>

<p>
In summary, given a uniformly distributed random year:

Given a year and month, often one needs to quickly find out how many

</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The algorithm looks so simple that it hardly needs any explanation.  However I'm
going to bore you with one anyway.  An early reviewer noted that sometimes one
already has the information that <code>y</code> is (or not) a leap year, and so
taking advantage of that information for performance reasons would be nice,
instead of recomputing it within <code>last_day_of_month</code>.  I found this
argument compelling, and set off to measure how much time I could save.
</p>

<p>
It turns out that if one simply replaces <code>Int y</code> with
<code>bool is_leap</code> in the above algorithm, the savings is
actually quite tiny.  So tiny it is hard to measure.  I was surprised by
this result, however the basic concept that the reviewer had: "avoid
<code>is_leap(y)</code> when possible," is sound.  And this was the
genesis of <code>last_day_of_month_common_year</code> and
<code>last_day_of_month_leap_year</code>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
First an analysis of the current implementation of
<code>last_day_of_month</code>:
</p>

<p>
Given a uniformly distributed <code>y</code>, and a uniformly distributed <code>m</code>
in the range [1, 12], the following table gives the odds of exactly what gets
executed in a call to <code>last_day_of_month(y, m)</code>:
</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="10">
<tr>
<th>This percentage of the time</th><th>this will get executed</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>91&frac23;%</td><td><code>m != 2</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6&frac14;%</td><td><code>(m != 2) && (y % 4 == 0)</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2%</td><td><code>(m != 2) && (y % 4 == 0) && (y % 100 != 0)</code></td>

<tr>
<td><sup>1</sup>/<sub>12</sub>%</td><td><code>(m != 2) && (y % 4 == 0) && (y % 100 != 0) && (y % 400 == 0)</code></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
In English, over 91% of the time, neither the function
<code>is_leap(y)</code>, nor the <code>bool is_leap</code> is even
touched.  Additionally in over 6% of the cases, the only additional code
is a <code>% 4</code> which is typically optimized to a <code>&
0x3</code>.  Bitwise-ands are so fast they are practically free.  So
we're up to 97<sup>11</sup>/<sub>12</sub>% of the time actually
computing <code>is_leap(y)</code> is just as fast or very nearly just as
fast.  In 2% of the cases, avoiding the <code>is_leap(y)</code>
computation saves a <code>%</code> operation.  And in
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>12</sub> of 1% of the cases, avoiding the
<code>is_leap(y)</code> computation saves two <code>%</code> operations.
Although a <code>%</code> operation is a significant expense, they
happen so rarely in this code that this just isn't good enough to
justify another signature.
</p>

<p>
However if one can remove <b>all</b> branches from an entire year's
worth of calls to <code>last_day_of_month</code>, then you've got a
small but measurable performance optimization.  For example if you're
looping over all months in a year, then you should be able to compute
<code>is_leap(y)</code> exactly once, then branch exactly once, and then
get the number of days in each month with no further testing.  And this
is the reason <code>last_day_of_month_common_year</code> and
<code>last_day_of_month_leap_year</code> are introduced.

<h2><a name="weekday_from_days"></a><code>weekday_from_days</code></h2>

<p>
The day-of-the-week is most conveniently computed from the serial date. 
These formulas use the C and C++ convention that [0, 6] represents [Sun,
Sat].  First the algorithm, and then the explanation:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="1" cellpadding="10">

<p>
There are really two formulas, both based on doing <code>% 7</code>. 
When the lhs argument for the % operator is not negative, then
<code>(z+4) % 7</code> has pleasing results.  Recall that <code>z ==
0</code> corresponds to 1970-01-01. It is easily verified that this day
was a Thursday.  Thus <code>weekday_from_days(0)</code> should yield 4,
<code>weekday_from_days(1)</code> should yield 5, and so on. <code>(z+4) %
7</code> achieves this and it is easy to see will always be correct for
all dates after 1970-01-01.
</p>

<p>
Getting weekdays prior to 1970-01-01 requires a bit more work.  But we
can start with <code>weekday_from_days(-1)</code> should yield 3 (the day before
Thursday is Wednesday).  This actually works with <code>(z+4) % 7</code>, but
stops working by the time we get to <code>weekday_from_days(-5)</code>, which should be
6 (Sat).  Instead the formula yields -1.  For these and all previous dates,
after we <code>% 7</code>, giving a number in the range [-6, 0], we need to add
6 to get the number back into the desired range [0, 6].  And furthermore we
need a new offset to ensure that <code>weekday_from_days(-5) == 6</code>.  The formula
<code>(z+5) % 7 + 6</code> does the trick.
</p>

<p>
This is all equivalent to a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation">modulo operation based on floored or Euclidean division.</a>
So if your C++98/03 compiler implements floored or Euclidean division (it
may or may not), then you can simply <code>return (z+4) % 7</code>.  If
you are unsure, the unit tests below will detect the error if the code
is inconsistent with the compiler's definition of integral division.

This algorithm views the range [Sun, Sat] ([0, 6]) as a circular range.  Once
you reach Sat, it is not the end of the range.  Instead Sun is the next element
in the range.  And the cycle repeats.  Given that, how many days do you need to
add to <code>y</code> to get <code>x</code>?
</p>

<p>
The algorithm takes advantage of the requirement that unsigned integers shall
obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> where <i>n</i> is the
number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer.
That is, if <code>x -= y</code> "underflows", it is brought back into range with
<code>+ 7</code>.  Because this is unsigned arithmetic, there is no undefined
behavior.
</p>

<p>
A higher-level library may choose to provide pre-condition checking prior to
calling this low-level algorithm.

Here is a complete unit-test for this function:

<p>
First some static_asserts are performed to nail down some basics.  If
your compiler does not support the C++1y constexpr rules, you will need
to verify these at run time with <code>assert</code> instead.  The
<code>static_assert</code>s confirm that 1970-01-01 is day 0, and that
this day is a Thursday.
</p>

<p>
In <code>main()</code> I've chosen to test every day between
-1,000,000-01-01 and 1,000,000-12-31.  This is a total of 730,485,366
days, spanning a range far greater than the civil calendar is actually
valid.  So the test is overkill. However one of the goals of these
formulas is to not burden the client with the need to range check, or
worry about the range of validity of the formulas.  All the user really
has to worry about is if he really should be using the civil
calendar for the Jurassic period (certainly possible when these
functions are instantiated with <code>long long</code>).
</p>

<p>
The test loops over each year, each month of each year, and each day of each
month.  It computes the serial date from each <code>year/month/day</code>
triple and ensures that this is 1 greater than the previous iteration.  It
then converts the serial date back to a <code>year/month/day</code> triple
and ensures that this is the same triple it started this iteration with.  And
finally the test ensures that the weekday for this date is one day later in the
week than was the weekday for the previous iteration.
</p>

<p>
I've also timed the entire test.  On my machine (2.8 GHz Intel Core i5
iMac) this executes at -O3 in about 17.1 seconds which means it is
testing each date in about 23.4 ns.  These functions are not slow.

For me this outputs:

<blockquote><pre>

<p>
I've used <code>civil_from_days</code> to turn a <code>chrono::duration</code>
obtained from <code>system_clock::now()</code> into a
<code>year/month/day</code> triple. For grins I've also subtracted off
the days from the duration to get the hours, subtracted off the hours to
get minutes, and subtracted off the minutes to get seconds, so I can
print out the current time along with the current date.  On my system I
can even print the current time with microsecond accuracy if I want
(something not even possible with the C interface).
</p>

<p>
One can also go the other way:  Specify a date in terms of a
<code>year/month/day</code> triple and then convert that into a
<code>system_clock::time_point</code>:

<h2><a name="Example:  Finding nth weekday of month"></a>Example:  Finding nth weekday of month</h2>

<p>
<code>weekday_difference</code> is handy for computing dates like the
4th Saturday in May, or the last Sunday of Jun.  For an example of the
former consider:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
std::tuple&lt;int, unsigned, unsigned&gt;
get_nth_dow_month_year(unsigned n, unsigned wd, unsigned month, int year)
{
    <font color="#C80000">// Do validation here</font>
    assert(n <= 4);  <font color="#C80000">// We could possibly allow n == 5, but it would sometimes fail</font>
    assert(wd <= 6);
    assert(1 <= month && month <= 12);
    const unsigned wd_1st = weekday_from_days(days_from_civil(year, month, 1));
    const unsigned day = <b>weekday_difference(wd, wd_1st)</b> + 1 + (n-1)*7;
    return std::tuple&lt;int, unsigned, unsigned&gt;(year, month, day);
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
First compute the weekday of the first day of the month.  Then add to the first
day of the month the difference between the weekday you want and the weekday you
have.  This will be some number between 0 and 6.  And then add to that n-1 weeks.
Now you have a <code>year/month/day</code> triple.  If instead you wanted to
return a <code>system_clock::time_point</code>, that is just as easy:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
std::chrono::system_clock::time_point
get_nth_dow_month_year(unsigned n, unsigned wd, unsigned month, int year)
{
    <font color="#C80000">// Do validation here</font>
    <font color="#C80000">// Don't actually need to check n</font>
    assert(wd <= 6);
    assert(1 <= month && month <= 12);
    using namespace std;
    using namespace std::chrono;
    typedef duration&lt;int, ratio_multiply&lt;hours::period, ratio&lt;24&gt;&gt;&gt; days;
    int d = days_from_civil(year, month, 1);
    const unsigned wd_1st = weekday_from_days(d);
    d += <b>weekday_difference(wd, wd_1st)</b> + (n-1)*7;
    return system_clock::time_point(days(d));
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If you are wanting to get the last weekday of a month, this is also very easy
using <code>weekday_difference</code>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
std::tuple&lt;int, unsigned, unsigned&gt;
get_last_dow_month_year(unsigned wd, unsigned month, int year)
{
    <font color="#C80000">// Do validation here</font>
    assert(wd <= 6);
    assert(1 <= month && month <= 12);
    const unsigned last = last_day_of_month(year, month);
    const unsigned wd_last = weekday_from_days(days_from_civil(year, month, last));
    const unsigned day = last - <b>weekday_difference(wd_last, wd)</b>;
    return std::tuple&lt;int, unsigned, unsigned&gt;(year, month, day);
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
You simply compute the weekday of the last day of the month, and then use
<code>weekday_difference</code> to find the number of days that need to be
subtracted from the last day of the month to get to the desired weekday.
</p>

<p>
In some circumstances you might want to find the next weekday, not counting
the "current day".  For example you may need the next Thu from today, and if
today is a Thu, you need a week from today, not today.  In this use case,
combining <code>weekday_difference</code> with <code>next_weekday</code> is
very handy:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
int meeting_day = tomorrow + <b>weekday_difference(</b>desired_weekday, <b>next_weekday(</b>todays_weekday<b>))</b>;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Where <code>tomorrow</code> is just <code>today+1</code> and
<code>todays_weekday</code> is today's weekday.

<h2><a name="Example: Converting between the civil calendar and the ISO week calendar"></a>Example: Converting between the civil calendar and the ISO week calendar</h2>

<p>
These algorithms can be used to easily convert between the civil calendar and the
ISO week-based calendar.  The ISO rules for this calendar are:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
The week starts with Monday, and ends with Sunday.
</li>
<li>
The first day of the year is the Monday that occurs on or before Jan. 4.
</li>
<li>
A date is specified by the week number [1 - 53], day of the week [Mon -
Sun] and year number.
</li>
<li>
The year number is the same as the civil year number for the Thursday
that follows the start of the week-based year.
<ul>
<li>
This makes it possible for a day in the week-based year to have a
different year number than in the civil calendar for that day.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
ISO 8601 gives two examples:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Sunday Jan. 1, 1995 is the Sunday of week 52 of the year 1994. (Week 1
of 1995 starts on Monday Jan. 2, 1995)
</li>
<li>
Tuesday Dec. 31, 1996 is the Tuesday of week 1 of the year 1997. (The
first day of the week-based year 1997 begins on Monday Dec. 30, 1996, which is
the first Monday on or before Jan. 4, 1997, a Saturday)
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Here are functions for converting from <code>year/month/day</code> to
<code>year/week/weekday</code> and back.  It is first convenient to create
a function that finds the "time_point" (count of days since epoch) of the
first day of the week-based year given the year number.  This year number is
actually the week-based year number, not the civil year number:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
int
iso_week_start_from_year(int y)
{
    const unsigned Monday = 1;
    const unsigned Jan = 1;
    const int tp = days_from_civil(y, Jan, 4);
    const unsigned wd = weekday_from_days(tp);
    return tp - static_cast&lt;int&gt;(weekday_difference(wd, Monday));
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
To ease confusion and allow reuse of the code we've developed, we
continue to encode our days [Sun, Sat] as [0, 6], despite the fact that
Sun/0 is now the last day of the week instead of the first.
</p>

<p>
Given the tools in our toolbox, this function is remarkably easy to create from
rule 2 above:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Turn y-01-04 into a serial date.
</li>
<li>
Get the weekday of y-01-04.
</li>
<li>
Subtract off the number of days the current weekday is past Monday.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Using the <code>iso_week_start_from_year</code> helper function, it is
now easy to convert from <code>year/month/day</code> to
<code>year/week_number/week_day</code>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
<font color="#C80000">// year, week[1, 53], weekday[0, 6]</font>
std::tuple&lt;int, unsigned, unsigned&gt;
iso_week_from_civil(int y, unsigned m, unsigned d)
{
    const unsigned Monday = 1;
    const unsigned Thursday = 4;
    const int tp = days_from_civil(y, m, d);
    int iso_week_start = iso_week_start_from_year(y);
    if (tp &lt; iso_week_start)
        iso_week_start = iso_week_start_from_year(y-1);
    else
    {
        const int iso_week_next_year_start = iso_week_start_from_year(y+1);
        if (tp &gt;= iso_week_next_year_start)
            iso_week_start = iso_week_next_year_start;
    }
    const unsigned weekday = weekday_from_days(tp);
    const unsigned week = (tp - iso_week_start) / 7 + 1;
    int year;
    std::tie(year, std::ignore, std::ignore) =
        civil_from_days(iso_week_start + int(Thursday - Monday));
    return std::tuple&lt;int, unsigned, unsigned&gt;(year, week, weekday);
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
We're going to need to easily compare dates using less-than.  To do that we
need to work in terms of serial dates, so we convert both the <code>y/m/d</code>
and the start of the ISO week-based year into serial dates (<code>tp</code> and
<code>iso_week_start</code>).
</p>

<p>
Recall that the input to <code>iso_week_start_from_year</code> is the
week-based year number, not the civil year number.  So it is possible
that our year number is one off, causing the current date to fall
outside of the range of the ISO week-based year we just computed.  The
ISO 8601 examples given above are both cases where this happens.  So we
test if <code>tp</code> is prior to <code>iso_week_start</code>.  If it
is, then we need to change the start of the ISO week to that of the
previous year.  Otherwise we need to check if <code>tp</code> falls in
the following ISO week-based year, and if so change
<code>iso_week_start</code> to the following year.
</p>

<p>
Once past the if-statement, <code>iso_week_start</code> is the correct beginning
of the week-based year that contains <code>tp</code>.  We need the weekday of
<code>tp</code>, easily computed with <code>weekday_from_days</code>.  We need
the week number, easily computed by finding out how many weeks <code>tp</code>
is beyond <code>iso_week_start</code>, and recalling that the week number is
1-based, not 0-based.  And finally we need to implement ISO rule 4 which says
that the year number is that of the civil date for the Thursday that follows
the start of the ISO week-based year.
</p>

<p>
The reverse conversion, from <code>year/week_number/week_day</code> to
<code>year/month/day</code> is even easier:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
<font color="#C80000">// year, month[1, 12], day[1, 31]</font>
std::tuple&lt;int, unsigned, unsigned&gt;
civil_from_iso_week(int y, unsigned w, unsigned wd)
{
    int tp = iso_week_start_from_year(y) + (w-1) * 7 + (wd == 0 ? 6 : wd - 1);
    return civil_from_days(tp);
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
One simply converts the week-based year into a serial date by using our helper
function <code>iso_week_start_from_year</code>, the number of 1-based weeks,
and the day of the week.  For the latter, recall that Sunday is the last day of
the week, or day 6 of the week, and Monday is the first day of the week, or day
0 of the week.  Once we have a serial date, it is now trivial to convert that
to a civil date using <code>civil_from_days</code>.
</p>

<p>
Note that in any of these formulas, the variable named <code>tp</code> is a
serial date, compatible with <code>chrono::system_clock::time_point</code>,
and so you could just as easily be converting to or from a
<code>chrono::system_clock::time_point</code> using:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
typedef duration&lt;int, ratio_multiply&lt;hours::period, ratio&lt;24&gt;&gt;&gt; days;
<font color="#C80000">// tp -&gt; time_point</font>
system_clock::time_point time_point(days(tp));
<font color="#C80000">// time_point -&gt; tp</font>
int tp2 = duration_cast&lt;days&gt;(time_point.time_since_epoch()).count();
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
And actually, if you anticipate converting negative <code>system_clock::time_point</code>s
you should create yourself a <code>round_down</code> function and use that in
place of <code>duration_cast</code>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class To, class Rep, class Period&gt;
To
round_down(const std::chrono::duration&lt;Rep, Period&gt;&amp; d)
{
    To t = std::chrono::duration_cast&lt;To&gt;(d);
    if (t &gt; d)
        --t;
    return t;
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
For example if your <code>system_clock::time_point</code> contains a duration
of seconds(-1), and you convert that to <code>days</code>, you want
<code>days</code> to be -1 (midnight 1969-12-31), not 0 (midnight 1970-01-01).
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
<font color="#C80000">// time_point -&gt; tp</font>

<p>
It is relatively straight forward to derive <code>days_from_julian</code> from
<code>days_from_civil</code> by simply adjusting the constants in
<code>days_from_civil</code>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
<font color="#C80000">// Returns number of days since civil 1970-01-01.  Negative values indicate</font>
<font color="#C80000">//    days prior to 1970-01-01.</font>
<font color="#C80000">// Preconditions:  y-m-d represents a date in the Julian calendar</font>
<font color="#C80000">//                 m is in [1, 12]</font>
<font color="#C80000">//                 d is in [1, last_day_of_month_julian(y, m)]</font>
<font color="#C80000">//                 y is "approximately" in</font>
<font color="#C80000">//                   [numeric_limits&lt;Int&gt;::min()/366, numeric_limits&lt;Int&gt;::max()/366]</font>
template &lt;class Int&gt;
constexpr
Int
days_from_julian(Int y, unsigned m, unsigned d) noexcept
{
    static_assert(std::numeric_limits&lt;Int&gt;::digits &gt;= 20,
             "This algorithm has not been ported to a 16 bit signed integer");
    y -= m &lt;= 2;
    const Int era = (y &gt;= 0 ? y : y-3) / 4;
    const unsigned yoe = static_cast&lt;unsigned&gt;(y - era * 4);        <font color="#C80000">// [0, 3]</font>
    const unsigned doy = (153*(m + (m &gt; 2 ? -3 : 9)) + 2)/5 + d-1;  <font color="#C80000">// [0, 365]</font>
    const unsigned doe = yoe * 365 + doy;                           <font color="#C80000">// [0, 1460]</font>
    return era * 1461 + static_cast&lt;Int&gt;(doe) - 719470;
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
In the Julian calendar the era is only 4 years long instead of 400.  This greatly
simplifies everything.  Otherwise we still use the the same basic design and
algorithms as developed for <code>days_from_civil</code>.  The one tricky part
is that the constant to shift the epoch to the <code>chrono</code>-compatible
<b>civil</b> 1970-01-01, the constant 719468 needs to be adjusted.  To find the
right shift, it is handy to note that there is a well-documented equivalence
between the Julian and civil calendars:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
static_assert(days_from_julian(1582, 10, 5) == days_from_civil(1582, 10, 15),
              "Rome switches from Julian to Gregorian");
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If this equivalence does not hold true, then the epochs are not properly
aligned.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, <code>julian_from_days</code> is derived from
<code>civil_from_days</code> by simply adjusting the constants:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
<font color="#C80000">// Returns year/month/day triple in Julian calendar</font>
<font color="#C80000">// Preconditions:  z is number of days since 1970-01-01 (civil) and is not "too close"</font>
<font color="#C80000">//                   to numeric_limits&lt;Int&gt;::min() or numeric_limits&lt;Int&gt;::max().</font>
template &lt;class Int&gt;
constexpr
std::tuple&lt;Int, unsigned, unsigned&gt;
julian_from_days(Int z) noexcept
{
    static_assert(std::numeric_limits&lt;Int&gt;::digits &gt;= 20,
             "This algorithm has not been ported to a 16 bit signed integer");
    z += 719470;
    const Int era = (z &gt;= 0 ? z : z - 1460) / 1461;
    const unsigned doe = static_cast&lt;unsigned&gt;(z - era * 1461);  <font color="#C80000">// [0, 1460]</font>
    const unsigned yoe = (doe - doe/1460) / 365;                 <font color="#C80000">// [0, 3]</font>
    const Int y = static_cast&lt;Int&gt;(yoe) + era * 4;
    const unsigned doy = doe - 365 * yoe;                        <font color="#C80000">// [0, 365]</font>
    const unsigned mp = (5*doy + 2)/153;                         <font color="#C80000">// [0, 11]</font>
    const unsigned d = doy - (153*mp+2)/5 + 1;                   <font color="#C80000">// [1, 31]</font>
    const unsigned m = mp + (mp &lt; 10 ? 3 : -9);                  <font color="#C80000">// [1, 12]</font>
    return std::tuple&lt;Int, unsigned, unsigned&gt;(y + (m &lt;= 2), m, d);
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
And now one can easily convert between the civil and Julian calendars by simply
converting to the serial calendar in between, for example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
std::tuple&lt;int, unsigned, unsigned&gt;
julian_from_civil(int y, unsigned m, unsigned d)
{
    return julian_from_days(days_from_civil(y, m, d));
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
It is also interesting, and somewhat amusing, to note that the
<code>weekday_from_days</code> function is just as valid for the Julian calendar
as it is for the civil calendar.  Some things even the pope won't mess with!
But note that <code>is_leap</code> and <code>last_day_of_month</code> are not
valid for the Julian calendar.  Though it is certainly trivial to write
Julian versions of these functions if desired.

Good question.  I could be full of hot air.

Run the following program while noting through an independent source what the
current time in the UTC timezone is:
</p>

<blockqote><pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;chrono&gt;
#include &lt;iomanip&gt;

void
print_current_utc_date_time()
{
    using namespace std;
    using namespace std::chrono;
    typedef duration&lt;int, ratio_multiply&lt;hours::period, ratio&lt;24&gt;&gt;&gt; days;
    auto now = system_clock::now().time_since_epoch();
    auto today = duration_cast&lt;days&gt;(now);
    int year;
    unsigned month;
    unsigned day;
    std::tie(year, month, day) = civil_from_days(today.count());
    now -= today;
    auto h = duration_cast&lt;hours&gt;(now);
    now -= h;
    auto m = duration_cast&lt;minutes&gt;(now);
    now -= m;
    auto s = duration_cast&lt;seconds&gt;(now);
    cout.fill('0');
    cout &lt;&lt; "Today is "
         &lt;&lt; year &lt;&lt; '-'
         &lt;&lt; setw(2) &lt;&lt; (unsigned)month &lt;&lt; '-'
         &lt;&lt; setw(2) &lt;&lt; (unsigned)day
         &lt;&lt; " at " &lt;&lt; setw(2) &lt;&lt; h.count() &lt;&lt; ':'
         &lt;&lt; setw(2) &lt;&lt; m.count() &lt;&lt; ':'
         &lt;&lt; setw(2) &lt;&lt; s.count() &lt;&lt; " UTC\n";
}

int
main()
{
    print_current_utc_date_time();
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The reported time through this program, and your independent source should be
identical down to the nearest second.  If they are, then the assumptions about
your <code>std::chrono::system_clock</code> epoch are correct.  If the two
times disagree, you can still fix it.
</p>

<p>
If the times differ by more than 86400 seconds, then you can alter the constant
719468 in <code>days_from_civil</code> and <code>civil_from_days</code> to
whatever it takes to bring the difference down below 86400 seconds.
</p>

<p>
If the times differ by less than 86400 seconds then you will need to
add/subtract that many seconds whenever you convert a <code>days</code>
duration from <code>days_from_civil</code> to/from a
<code>std::chrono::system_clock::time_point</code>.  One possibility is that
the <code>std::chrono::system_clock</code> implementation is taking
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_seconds">leap seconds</a> into
account.
</p>

<p>
My best guess is that you will never run into this problem.  I have
surveyed the LLVM libc++, the GNU libstdc++, and MVC++.  My personal
experience with this survey is only with libc++.  I'm counting on
reports from others for libstdc++ and MVC++.  But in all cases I'm
seeing the use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">unix
time</a>.  Implementations will not easily change their epoch, even
though the epoch is unspecified, as the epoch is detectible.  I.e. the
epoch is part of an implementation's ABI.

<h2><a name="Summary"></a>Summary</h2>

We don't have a modern date class in the std::lib, and that is somewhat of a
pain.  However these formulas are nice to have in your toolbox, and can be
quite useful, even without a type-safe date class.  Maybe they don't have quite
the right interface.  Maybe the names aren't the best.  But the formulas are
good.  Consider these donated to the public domain.  Perhaps you can use them
to create the next great date class!

<h2><a name="Acknowledgments"></a>Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>
I do not claim that any of these formulas are original.  For example I've seen
the shift to March as the first month of the year many times before.  I haven't
seen the use of eras before, nor the use of the equation that transforms a
day-of-era into a year-of-era before.  However I would be surprised if this was
the first use of these formulations.

Thanks to Vicente J. Botet whose comments caused me to rethink several aspects
of this paper.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Jonathan Sauer who pointed out to me that C++98/03 compilers
are allowed to implement truncated, floored or Euclidean integral
division.  However C++11 specifies truncated.  I am unaware of any
C++98/03 compiler that does not implement truncated division, which is probably
why C++11 was able to change from implementation defined to truncated.
