<h2>Introduction</h2>

<hr/>
<p>
<b>Update:</b>
</p>

<p>
I've updated this article with a new allocator that is fully C++11 conforming.
The allocator it replaces was not fully C++03 nor C++11 conforming because
copies were not equal.
</p>
<hr/>

<p>
Sometimes you need a container that is <i>almost</i> always going to hold just a
few elements, but it must be prepared for the "large" use case as well.  It is
often advantageous to have the container allocate off of the local stack up to
a given size, in order to avoid a dynamic allocation for the common case.
</p>

<p>
Programmers often believe they need to write custom containers to get this
optimization instead of using the standard containers such as
<tt>std::vector&lt;T&gt;</tt> and <tt>std::list&lt;T&gt;</tt>.  This is certainly
doable.  However I do not believe this is the best way to go.
</p>

<p>
Instead I prefer to write a custom allocator which can be used with any of the
standard containers.  This custom allocator can be written in several different
variants and this brief paper outlines only one.  But in general, such an
allocator refers to a buffer either on the stack, or with static or thread
storage duration.  So the end result is the same as writing your own
container, but you get to reuse the standard container code.
</p>

<p>
Allocator requirements for C++11 are backwards compatible in that C++98/03
allocators will work in C++11 containers.  However C++11 allocators will not
work in C++98/03 containers.  The allocator demonstrated here is purposefully a
C++11 allocator and thus will not work with C++98/03 containers.  I chose this
presentation because C++11 allocators need not have a lot of distracting
boiler-plate (it can be defaulted). However it is a relatively trivial task to
add the boiler-plate C++98/03 allocator requirements to this allocator if
desired.

<h2>A small <tt>vector</tt></h2>

<blockquote><pre>
#include "<a href="short_alloc.h">short_alloc.h</a>"
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;new&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

std::size_t memory = 0;
std::size_t alloc = 0;

void* operator new(std::size_t s) throw(std::bad_alloc)
{
    memory += s;
    ++alloc;
    return malloc(s);
}

void  operator delete(void* p) throw()
{
    --alloc;
    free(p);
}

void memuse()
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "memory = " &lt;&lt; memory &lt;&lt; '\n';
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "alloc = " &lt;&lt; alloc &lt;&lt; '\n';

int main()
{
    const unsigned N = 200;
    using Alloc = short_alloc&lt;int, N, alignof(int)&gt;;
    using SmallVector = std::vector&lt;int, Alloc&gt;;
    Alloc::arena_type a;
    SmallVector v{Alloc(a)};
    v.push_back(1);
    memuse();
    v.push_back(2);

<p>
In the above example I've created a custom <tt>new/delete</tt> just for the purpose
of monitoring heap allocations.  A <tt>vector&lt;int&gt;</tt> is created that
will allocate up to 100 <tt>bytes</tt>'s before going to the heap.
</p>

<h2>A small <tt>list</tt></h2>

<p>
This works with <tt>list</tt> too:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
int main()
{
    const unsigned N = 200;
    using Alloc = short_alloc&lt;int, N&gt;;
    using SmallList = std::list&lt;Alloc::value_type, Alloc&gt;;
    Alloc::arena_type a;
    SmallList v{Alloc(a)};
    v.push_back(1);
    memuse();
    v.push_back(2);
    memuse();
    v.push_back(3);
    memuse();
    v.push_back(4);
    memuse();
    for (auto i : v)
        std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; ' ';
    std::cout &lt;&lt; '\n';
}

memory = 0
alloc = 0
memory = 0
alloc = 0
memory = 0
alloc = 0
memory = 0
alloc = 0

<h2>A small <tt>set</tt></h2>

<p>
Yes, you can make a small <tt>set</tt> too:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
typedef std::set&lt;int, std::less&lt;int&gt;, short_alloc&lt;int, 200&gt;&gt; SmallSet;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Next time you're tempted to write your own container, take a moment to explore
the possibility of reusing the standard containers.  That's what they are there
for.  You may be surprised at how they can be customized to meet your needs.
