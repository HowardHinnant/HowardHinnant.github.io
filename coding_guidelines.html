<h2>Priorities</h2>

<p>
At first it seemed really dumb to me to list priorities.  No one disputes the
following items are important. But it is easy to mistakenly prioritize a less
important priority over a more important priority.  So below are my
priorities, listed most important first.  And I endeavor to always value all
of these priorities, and yet never reorder them.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
Correctness.
</p>
<p>
There can be nothing more important than code that robustly works as
advertised with no surprises.  Faster code that gets the wrong answer is not
superior to correct code.  The act of writing code that is testable (and
writing those tests) greatly lends itself to writing correct code.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Run time performance.
</p>
<p>
If the code is correct, but runs so slow that nobody can use it, then nobody
<i>will</i> use it.  "Slow" is defined by the client though.  What may be too
slow for some clients may be fine for others.  Code should be as fast as
possible, but no faster.  Code size, memory usage and disk usage is also
included in this category.  Any resource that your code uses at run time, be
it processor cycles, ram, network I/O bandwidth, disk space or disk I/O
bandwidth, is a limited resource and if your code squanders any resource,
this will cause problems for your clients.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Compile time performance.
</p>
<p>
Code should compile as fast as possible, but without compromising correctness
nor run time performance.  This is especially true for code that lives in
headers, as it is compiled more often than code that lives in source files.
Additionally code should be designed to not require excessive ram to compile.
Use of excessive ram can also lead to needlessly long compile times due to
paging.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Maintainability / Easy to read.
</p>
<p>
These are really two closely related goals.  Code that is hard to read is not
maintainable, and generally code that is not maintainable will turn out to be
difficult to read as well.  What makes code maintainable and easy to read?
Simplicity goes a long way.  It is easy to get carried away with
over-generalizing everything on the off chance you may need it one day.  Code
should be as simple as possible to meet the task at hand, and no simpler.
Simplicity will positively feed back into our other priorities.  Note however
that more verbosity does not always translate into easier to read code.
Identifiers should be long enough to give meaning, but short enough that a line
of code does not expand into a paragraph of code.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Easy to write.
</p>
<p>
Making code easy to write is important.  However it is the least important of
all of our goals.  Code is read (by humans) far more often than it is
written. Thus a good programmer will optimize his code for being read, even
at the expense of making his code harder to write.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Never sacrifice a higher priority for a lower priority.  All of these
priorities are "mom and apple pie" (no one could disagree they are good
ideas).  But an engineer knows that there are always tradeoffs, and knows
which priorities should be sacrificed for other priorities (and when).
</p>

<h2>Measure</h2>

<p>
If you think something is correct, prove it with a test.  If you think something
is fast, time it.  If you think one algorithm is better than another, find some
way to make a measurement to support your argument.
</p>

<p>
Do not depend only upon your "common sense."  Do not depend only on theory.
It is good to use theory to help guide you to an optimum solution.  But
without measuring, you have no way of knowing (nor convincing others) of the
correctness of your theory.  Without measurement, you have a faith-based
system, not a scientific theory.  
</p>

<p>
If what you need to measure is too complicated to measure, break the problem
down into a collection of smaller problems that can be measured.  Making
<b>some</b> measurement is infinitely better than making <b>no</b>
measurements. And whatever you do, do not depend upon yourself or someone
else just saying: "trust me, I know what I'm talking about."  If we all did
that, all of the time, the earth would be flat and at the center of the
universe.
</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>
Not only do you need to test that something works, you also need to test that
it fails when and how you expect it to.  For example make sure asserts fire
when they are supposed to.  Make sure that what you assume won't compile
actually doesn't compile.  Make sure that the exception actually is thrown,
and that no resource leaks happen during stack unwinding.  Test corner cases
such as 0, 1, -1, INT_MIN, INT_MIN+1,  INT_MAX-1, and INT_MAX.
</p>

<!-- 
<h2>Document function preconditions and class invariants</h2>

<p>
Not all functions have preconditions.  And not all classes have class
invariants.  But when they do, document them with comments in the code.
For example here is
<a href="http://home.roadrunner.com/~hinnant/date_algorithms.html#days_from_civil"><code>days_from_civil</code></a>
which turns a <code>{y, m, d}</code> triple into a serial day count:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
<font color="#C80000">// Returns number of days since civil 1970-01-01.  Negative values indicate</font>
<font color="#C80000">//    days prior to 1970-01-01.</font>
<font color="#C80000">// Preconditions:  y-m-d represents a date in the civil (Gregorian) calendar</font>
<font color="#C80000">//                 m is in [1, 12]</font>
<font color="#C80000">//                 d is in [1, last_day_of_month(y, m)]</font>
<font color="#C80000">//                 y is "approximately" in</font>
<font color="#C80000">//                   [numeric_limits&lt;Int&gt;::min()/366, numeric_limits&lt;Int&gt;::max()/366]</font>
<font color="#C80000">//                 Exact range of validity is:</font>
<font color="#C80000">//                 [civil_from_days(numeric_limits&lt;Int&gt;::min()),</font>
<font color="#C80000">//                  civil_from_days(numeric_limits&lt;Int&gt;::max()-719468)]</font>
template &lt;class Int&gt;
constexpr
Int
days_from_civil(Int y, unsigned m, unsigned d) noexcept;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This function is purposefully designed to trust that the client will pass in
valid values for the year, month and day.  This is what a precondition is.  If
the client passes in invalid values, the behavior of this function is undefined.
The result is neither documented, predicted, nor tested for.  It is important
that preconditions be prominently documented like the above. 
</p>

<p>
A class invariant is a relationship among a type's data members.  Access to the
data members is restricted, and the classes constructors, member functions and
friends operate such that the relationship among the data members is maintained.
For example, here is a simple <code>vector</code> class:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class T&gt;
class vector
{
private:
    <font color="#C80000">// Either all three pointers equal nullptr, or none of them do.</font>
    <font color="#C80000">// If non-null, begin_ &lt;= end_ &amp;&amp; end_ &lt;= capacity_ &amp;&amp; begin_ &lt; capacity_</font>
    <font color="#C80000">// The range [begin_, end_) will contain constructed T's</font>
    <font color="#C80000">// The range [end_, capacity_) will uninitialized.</font>
    <font color="#C80000">// If non-null, begin_ is an owning pointer.</font>
    T* begin_;
    T* end_;
    T* capacity_;
    // ...
};
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
With these comments in place, the class practically writes itself.  Future
maintainers of this code can get a very quick idea of what this class does,
and what the rules are for this class.
</p>

<p>
Conversely, consider this simple type:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class T, class U&gt;
struct pair
{
    T first;
    U second;
};
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Here, the values of <code>first</code> and <code>second</code> are completely
independent of one another.  There are no class invariants to document.
</p>

<h2>Sweat over each special member function</h2>

<p>
There are six special members.  They are, in order of importance:
</p>

<ol>
<li>The destructor</li>
<li>The default constructor</li>
<li>The copy constructor</li>
<li>The copy assignment operator</li>
<li>The move constructor</li>
<li>The move assignment operator</li>
</ol>

<p>
Not every class has all 6 special members.  But <i>know</i> which special
members your class has.  It is ok to let the compiler implicitly provide
a special member for you.  But don't let that happen by accident.
</p>

<p>
For example if your class isn't supposed to be copyable, disable the copy
members.  Even if you aren't sure whether or not you want your class to be
copyable, disable the copy members.  Indeed, when you are first writing your
class <code>X</code>, it isn't a bad idea to start with this skeleton:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
class X
{
public:
    X(X const&amp;) = delete;
    X& operator=(X const&amp;) = delete;
};
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
As it stands <code>X</code> has a compiler provided destructor which is
<code>noexcept</code>.  It has no default constructor.  It has deleted copy
members, and it has no move members.  You can't do anything with this class.
You can't even construct an <code>X</code>.  Now add the functionality you
need.  If that functionality includes default constructing, copying, or
moving, add it.  If you add a data member that needs attention in the
destructor, add that attention at the same time as you add the data member.
</p>

<p>
Don't "gloss over" your special members.  They should be among the first
things designed and implemented as you author a new class.  They should not be
an afterthought.
</p>

<h2>Keep data members and special member functions close to each other</h2>
<h2>Don't over-inline</h2>
<h2>Keep functions relatively simple</h2>
<h2>Limit access to code and data</h2>
<h2>Design for compile-time failure</h2>
<h2>Squash warnings</h2>
<h2>Upgrade to the latest C++ standard as soon as practical</h2>
<h2>Code as if your life depended on your code</h2>
