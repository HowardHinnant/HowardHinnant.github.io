<a name="Introduction"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This paper is written to express strong opposition to changing the
meaning of <code>%S</code> as proposed in <a
href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2945r0
.html">P2945R0</a>. To be perfectly clear, this paper expresses no
objection to adding syntax to specify precision to <code>%S</code>.
This would not break any code.  The only objection is to changing the
meaning of <code>%S</code> from representing seconds exactly, to
representing only the integral part of seconds.
</p>

<a name="Bad"></a><h2>
Having a standard specify run-time changes to existing code is
<b>Bad</b><sup>TM</sup>
</h2>

<p>
The proper way to change a standard is to deprecate the old behavior,
and provide new syntax for the new behavior.  Let both behaviors
coexist for a few cycles, then remove the deprecated specification.
</p>
<p>
Doing otherwise risks introducing run-time errors to existing code by
simply upgrading to a new version of C++.  Such run-time errors have
the potential for raising safety and security issues.
</p>

<a name="Existing"><h2>
The <code>%S</code> flag as specified in the
<code>&lt;chrono&gt;</code> library is existing code
</h2>

<p>
It has been shipping in MSVC for over a year now.
</p>
<p>
It has been implented in gcc 14.0.0.
</p>
<p>
<code>%S</code> has been documented by the standard, by books, by
countless informal articles and postings, and by my date library.
</p>
<p>
<code>%S</code> has 7 years of positive field experience with this
syntax and behavior in my date library.
</p>

<a name="Good"><h2>
<code>%S</code> is a good design
</h2>

<p>
The design of <code>%S</code> follows the principles first laid down
by the C++11 version of <code>&lt;chrono&gt;</code>. 
<code>&lt;chrono&gt;</code> does not implicitly throw away
information.  This is true in conversion of units, and it remains true
in formatting.  All information is preserved unless truncating
behavior is explicitly requested.   And when it is explicitly
requested, there exists options on which way to truncate:  towards
zero, towards negative infinity, towards postive infinity, or to
nearest.
</p>

<p>
<code>&lt;chrono&gt;</code> was precision-neutral in C++11, and
remains so a decade later in C++23.  <a

<blockquote>
<p>
This paper proposes a solution that is <i>precision neutral</i>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
No single precision is promoted above others or given special
priviledges.  It is not up to <code>&lt;chrono&gt;</code> to decide
that one precision is better than another.  That decision is up to the
OS which talks directly to the hardware. And up to the client, who
knows what precision is best for their application.
<code>&lt;chrono&gt;</code> is just a middleman to make the syntax
between the OS and the client portable.
</p>

<p>
Clients often change the OS’s precision to their specification’s
precision at the point of input, such as wrapping a call to now:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
auto
GetCurrentTime()
{
   using namespace std::chrono;
   return floor&lt;milliseconds&gt;(system_clock::now());
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
And then traffic in those <code>time_point</code>s throughout their
library or application.  There may be many points of both formatting
and parsing involved throughout their application.  And at each point
they don’t have to worry about synchronizing their parse and format
statements with their specification’s precision.  They can just ask
for the time: <code>“%F %T”</code> (etc.).  And when their
specification changes, there is no pain point.  Formatting and parsing
<em>by default</em> automatically adjust.
</p>

<p>
<code>&lt;chrono&gt;</code> does not (and should not) carry all of
this respect for the client around and then when the client gets ready
to create a logging statement suddenly say:  Oh, you probably want the
precision a bunch of committee members decided upon.  No,
<code>&lt;chrono&gt;</code> should give the client the preicsion he
has already asked for (as the default, of course there should be a way
to change it).
</p>

<p>
Clients also value symmetry between the parsing and formatting strings
so that they only have to learn one micro-language and not two. 
During parsing <code>%S</code> takes its precision from the type being
parsed, and reads up to that amount of precision from the input
stream.  A piece-wise redesign of <code>&lt;chrono&gt;</code> without
an in-depth knowledge of the entire library is foolhardy at best.  And
in this case also disruptive and dangerous.
</p>

<p>
<code>%S</code> does not need to have identical functionality to other
languages. There are many ways in which <code>&lt;chrono&gt;</code>
differs from other date time libraries.  These differences are what
makes the <code>&lt;chrono&gt;</code> solution superior, in
safety, functionality and performance.
